Although an excellent game, with generally well-rounded battles, some encounters
in Baldur's Gate II lack the effort put into so many of the others. Some battles
are exquisitely designed, while others seem to have been put together in mere
minutes. Tyrus and I decided to try and bring more balance into those lacking
battles.

Together we came up with this mod. All feedback is appreciated, but please give
it a relevant subject (e.g. BG2: Battle Mod) to ensure a swift and efficient
response on our behalf.

We hope everyone enjoys it.

This mod runs on BGII. While some components work with SoA, it is recommended
that you have ToB installed to enjoy the full benefits.
This mod should be compatible with all current WeiDU mods.

1 - Extract the main EXE file into your BGII main directory.
    e.g. "C:\Games\Baldurs Gate II"

2 - Run "Setup-Battles.exe".

3 - Select the component(s) you wish to install.

You can uninstall any component(s) later by re-running "Setup-Battles.exe".

                     /------------------------------------\
                     | 1: Modified STATS.IDS  {Moonfruit} |
                     \------------------------------------/

Originally part of the Detectable Spells mod created by Cirerrek, which allows
better detection of active spells within scripts. The most useful aspect of this
is the ability to detect for an active Protection from Magical/Normal Weapons,
which will help to prevent an enemy from attacking to no avail.

NOTE: If you have the Detectable Spells mod installed, you do not need to
      install this component.

WARNING: The following components will not install or function correctly without
         the modified STATS.IDS file:
           Knights of Dark Renown

                         /----------------------------\
                         | 2: Improved Drizzt {Tyrus} |
                         \----------------------------/

I've always thought that the (optional) battle against Drizzt should be more
difficult, so I decided to make an Improved Drizzt mod, which I then added
to the Battles mod.

After demand Improved Drizzt was added to Bodhi's lair to make for more
believable allies.

To see all the individual changes for the Improved Drizzt mod prior to it's
incorporation into the Battles mod, see CHANGES-Drizzt.txt in the 'battles'
directory.

                /----------------------------------------------\
                | 3: Improved Mencar Pebblecrusher {Moonfruit} |
                \----------------------------------------------/

A good battle to practise your skills on is Mencar and Co. above the Den of the
Seven Vales. They are a well rounded group (2 warriors, 2 mages, 1 thief), yet
their combined battle power is somewhat pathetic to the more seasoned player.

This component gives them better equipment, and also improves the scripting for
all of them, especially Sorcerous Amon and Pooky.

There is also an additional encounter with Pooky's parents. Beware though - they
are very difficult.

Some people may find this encounter too difficult upon exit of the Dungeon, and
it is recommended you wait until around level 11 - 13, unless you wish to test
various new tactics.

                     /------------------------------------\
                     | 4: Improved Mad Cleric {Moonfruit} |
                     \------------------------------------/

When you enter the docks district, you are approached by a mad cleric who
worships Cyric. He is extremely easy to kill (usually 2 or 3 hits), which takes
all the fun out of this small encounter.

This component allows him to use mage spells instead of cleric ones, thereby
increasing his arsenal of damaging spells, as well as giving him some improved
equipment and droppable items.

Be warned though: this guy really is mad!

                     /------------------------------------\
                     | 5: Improved House Jae'llat {Tyrus} |
                     \------------------------------------/

This could never be classified as a fight, but merely as a butchery. To say the
least, this was a boring battle where the only noticeable reward was Water's
Edge: Scimitar +3 and a whole lot of pearls.

The difficulty has been drastically increased, as well as the addition of some
extra reward.

                      /----------------------------------\
                      | 6: Improved Lord Roenall {Tyrus} |
                      \----------------------------------/

Lord Roenall wants your castle, and if you say no and he will *eventually*
attack your castle with his pathetic 'army'.

It used to be that you could merely start the battle, kill Lord Roenall in
three seconds tops and the battle was over. Not anymore.

Lord Roenall and his goons have been made more challenging, seeing that you
usually face him right before finishing the game.

                    /--------------------------------------\
                    | 7: Improved Master Brain {Moonfruit} |
                    \--------------------------------------/

For the final boss of the Illithid Lair, the Master Brain is somewhat heavily
under-powered. He has a large amount of psychic power which is completely absent
from the game, making him a walkover.

This component makes him quite a bit tougher, and also allows him to make more
use of his immense psychic powers.

Some might find this a tad difficult, but I feel it may still not be enough of
an improvement (in Easy and Normal difficulty).

I would strongly suggest that seasoned players try this encounter on Core, or
even higher, to get the full experience.

                   /----------------------------------------\
                   | 8: Improved Wraith Sarevok {Moonfruit} |
                   \----------------------------------------/

Your half-brother, Sarevok the traitor - the demi-god who tried to claim your
life so that he may ascend Bhaal's Throne of Blood. He who took your foster
father's life without a moment's hesitation. Banished to hell, he awaits for you
to join him... with a NON-ENCHANTED weapon!

This component fixes one of the most exploited bugs in the game - the one which
allows you stand and watch as Sarevok attempts to hurt you. He also calls a few
friends to the party.

Not too difficult, but a significant improvement over the original.

              /--------------------------------------------------\
              | 9: Improved Cohrvale, Bregg & Alamas {Moonfruit} |
              \--------------------------------------------------/

The two most pathetic enemies in the game have got to be Cohrvale and Bregg,
the duo who hang around in the Slums below the Copper Coronet.

This is not a significant improvement as such, but more of a fix really. All I
have done matched their stats to their levels, and given them some better
equipment.

This component also slightly improves Alamas (the guy you fight in Surly's pit
in the Copper Coronet).

                       /--------------------------------\
                       | 10: Improved Firkraag  {Tyrus} |
                       \--------------------------------/

The battle against Firkraag is a tad boring, so I decided to spice things up a
bit. I have made it that you first fight Lord Jierdan wielding two very
interesting weapons (made by me, inspired by Moonfruit). He then changes into a
dragon.

I'm considering to rewrite his entire dialog completely so that things make a
bit more sense, but I'll see how thing go.

Many people may consider this far to difficult because I have used very
challenging scripts.

              /--------------------------------------------------\
              | 11: Improved Fire Giants (needs ToB) {Moonfruit} |
              \--------------------------------------------------/

Fire Giants, ferocious beings feared throughout the Realms, and yet in BGII they
fall to 3 Abi-Dalzim's. How cliché.

This component raises their magic resistances, and gives the average (Elite)
Fire Giant a few spells.

                      /----------------------------------\
                      | 12: Improved Shade Lord  {Tyrus} |
                      \----------------------------------/

This battle was very big anticlimax. After all the effort of going through the
Temple Ruins and the option of facing a Shadow Dragon, you finish it off with a
pathetic little battle.

You face a Shade Lord (woo scary), a level 20 barbarian that casts a few boring
spells and then attacked you but never hit you.

I have changed all scripts and creature files to make this battle a bit better.

                    /--------------------------------------\
                    | 13: Improved Trademeet Crypt {Tyrus} |
                    \--------------------------------------/

A small quest involving the retrieval of a mantle from a very dangerous crypt;
yeah right! This battle had two Skeletons and two Skeleton Warriors, and one
actually cast a few spells (woo).

This component will makes this quest a bit more dangerous.

                        /------------------------------\
                        | 14: Improved Dungeon {Tyrus} |
                        \------------------------------/

This component addresses two separate battles in Irenicus' Dungeon:

- The Cambion to the right of Ilyich
- The three thieves that you face right before leaving Irenicus' Dungeon

This component will make them more difficult, with bonus reward, but not as
ridiculously difficult as Improved Ilyich.

                  /------------------------------------------\
                  | 15: Improved Temple Sewers Party {Tyrus} |
                  \------------------------------------------/

This battle was never particularly difficult until the Improved Mages component,
which made Gaius a bit more irritating, but it was still very easy. There was a
suggestion to have it improved, so I did.

After Lamfáda's removal from Moonfruit's Ruad Mod, many people wanted the
Robe of Enduring to return. I have made one of Tarnor's friends a monk, and
you'll have to kill him for it.

Everybody's script has been changed, and better equipment and more experience
added.

             /----------------------------------------------------\
             | 16: Improved Kiser Jhaeri  (needs ToB) {Moonfruit} |
             \----------------------------------------------------/

(*** Under construction ***)

For a very cautious thief, the battle with Kiser is rather swift and simple.
With this component he makes better use of his natural thieving abilities,
including hiding and backstabbing.

(*** Under construction ***)

                        /------------------------------\
                        | 17: Improved Falahar {Tyrus} |
                        \------------------------------/

I'm guessing this is a battle that was supposed to be part of a quest but
producers didn't have time to finish it. I didn't know about it till a while
back and I haven't ever heard anybody saying anything about it.

Well let me tell you, when you fight four people, two of which are worth 12,000
XP, although they die after a few well placed shots. Everyone here isn't worth
the experience that you get from them.

This component will fix that.

                  /------------------------------------------\
                  | 18: Improved Drow Pit Fights {Moonfruit} |
                  \------------------------------------------/

This component improves the battle in Szordrin's Pit where you face four
"ferocious" beasts.

A slight improvement over the original tank-it-out version, this component only
makes them physically stronger.

They still use all their original spells though.

            /------------------------------------------------------\
            | 19: Improved Chromatic Demon (needs ToB) {Moonfruit} |
            \------------------------------------------------------/

Surely a demon as powerful as this cannot be without some followers?

This component adds a few interesting characters, and also increases the demon's
fighting and spell-casting ability.

                   /----------------------------------------\
                   | 20: Knights of Dark Renown {Moonfruit} |
                   \----------------------------------------/

Loosely based on the David Gemmell novel, this component was probably the most
enjoyable to create.

This encounter triggers when you reach level 15, but if you are not in the city
at that time it will only trigger when you return.

I won't spoil any of the surprise, but I will say this: it can be difficult, but
it can also be very easy.

                     /------------------------------------\
                     | 21: Arcane Avenger Kit {Moonfruit} |
                     \------------------------------------/

I've always thought there should be a kit that is very good against spell
casters. Many would dispute that the Wizardslayer effectively fits the task, but
I disagree. So I sat down and though about it, and this is what I came up with.


ARCANE AVENGER: Although the mere mention of their name strikes fear into the
very core of an arcane spellcaster, many Wizardslayers seek to improve upon
their already-abundant talents. This requires immense physical and spiritual
training, but the result is a being of unsurpassed raw power: the Arcane
Avenger.

Able to cross a magical threshold without a scratch, Arcane Avengers can harness
the power of immunity to all potentially-threatening spells - from Magic
Missiles to Flame Arrow; Cloudkill to Horrid Wilting; even the dreaded Time Stop.

Advantages:
- Gains a +5 bonus to THAC0 and Damage vs. Mages and Sorcerers.
- Gains a +5 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Spells.
- Ethereal Vision, once per day for every 10 levels. All invisible creatures are
  made visible every six seconds, for a duration of 60 seconds.
- Shimmering Force, once per day for every 10 levels. All offensive spells cast
  at the Arcane Avenger in the next 30 seconds will automatically be deflected.
- 9th level: Immunity to all Hold, Charm and Confusion spells.
- 15th level: The Arcane Avenger gains 4% magic resistance per level (i.e. 60%
  at 15th level).
- 17th level: Temporal Stasis, once per day. The Arcane Avenger is immune to
  Time Stop for the duration (30 seconds).

Disadvantages:
- May only obtain grand mastery in ordinary mage weapon types.
- Can only dual-class to a Mage (requires 18 Intelligence).
- Must be of a Neutral alignment.
- Only Humans, Elves and Gnomes may become Arcane Avengers.

                        /------------------------------\
                        | 22: Blademaster Kit  {Tyrus} |
                        \------------------------------/

This is loosely based on the Apprentice Kit created by Shin/Salvanas (I couldn't
get in contact with him) as well as the original Kensai.

To put it simply: this kit is a Kensai that can wear armor but cannot dual-
class.


BLADEMASTER: Men and women that travel the known world and study under various
masters to perfect their fighting skills. While they may delve into other areas,
they tend to focus on swordsmanship. They only fight in light armor and use
their incredible speed and accuracy to decimate their foes.

Advantages:
- Bonus -1 to AC and -1 AC to slashing every 4 levels
- A Blademaster starts off moving at +2 move
- Bonus +1 to hit, damage and attack speed for every 5 levels
- May use 'Sword Dance' ability one time per day for every 4 levels (starts at
  1st level with one use): this ability lasts 10 seconds and improves THAC0 and
  AC by three points and grants an extra attack.
- May use 'Kai' ability one time per day for every 5 levels (starts at 1st level
  with one use): this ability lasts 10 seconds and makes all attacks do maximum
  damage.

Disadvantages:
- May not wear armor greater than studded leather
- May not specialize in weapons other than swords
- May not become proficient in the 'Sword and Shield' style
- May not dual-class

                        /------------------------------\
                        | 23: Demon Knight Kit {Tyrus} |
                        \------------------------------/

Many people seem to enjoy playing with an evil character and this is my attempt
to make such a kit.

I have given this kit many advantages as well as disadvantages, but I will
gladly accept any comments/suggestions.


DEMON KNIGHT: Humans which have been consumed by the taint of Demonic blood and
are twisted into corruption, making their actions and powers resemble those of a
Demon. As a Demon Knight gains experience he or she gains many abilities that
other demons have.

A few examples are great resistance towards fire and magic as well as being able
to determine which plane he is in.

Advantages:
- Immune to fear and morale failure
- Immune to hold
- 40% resistance to fire
- 12th level: Becomes immune to Maze
- 15th level: Can summon a demon to aid in battle once per day
- 21st level: Becomes immune to Imprisonment
- Gains two points of magic resistance per level from level 1 to 20 (i.e. 40% at
  lv.20)
- Can cast Demonic Fear one time per day for every 4 levels (starts at 1st level
  with one use): All enemies within the area of effect when this spell is cast
  must save vs. spells or flee in terror
- Can cast Inner Sight one time per day for every 4 levels: When this spell is
  cast, an area roughly 70 feet in radius around the caster will be affected.
  Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile
  illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled.
- Can cast Fire Shield Red one time per day for every 8 levels (starts at 1st
  level with one use)
- Can get Aura of Flaming Death as a high level ability

Disadvantages:
- May not specialize in weapons other than Two-Handed Swords, Bastard Swords,
  Long Swords and Halberds
- Must have a Chaotic Evil alignment
- May not become proficient in the 'Sword and Shield' style
- May not dual-class
- Must be Human
- Maximum wisdom and charisma scores of 8
- Cannot use ranged weapons

                        /------------------------------\
                        | 24: Bastard Kit  {Moonfruit} |
                        \------------------------------/

This kit actually started off as a joke, but it ended up looking rather
interesting and enjoyable to make. It's a sort of tongue-in-cheek take on the
other kits in the game. Enjoy.


BASTARD: Cruel, cunning, conniving - these are the core elements to the
Bastard's savage survival. Rejected because of their heritage, they are forced
to live a harsh life, turning towards crime as a means of survival. Skilled with
the bastard sword and small blades, they are silent, efficient mercenary's who
seldom kill a victim without torturing them first. They also possess great
magical abilities - the power to summon call upon the Seven Deadly Sins.

Advantages:
- The Bastard is immune to backstabbing.
- Avarice, once per day at levels 9 and 18. Creates a magical weapon of the
  Bastard's choice for 15 seconds.
- Envy, once per day at levels 17 and 34. The Bastard can increase his damage,
  number of attacks, or movement rate for the duration (15 seconds).
- Gluttony, once per day at levels 5 and 10. The Bastard temporarily gains 30
  hit points for the duration (15 seconds).
- Lust, once per day at level 13. The Bastard may summons Sadistic Sarah to aid
  him in battle. The duration is 5 minutes.
- Sloth, once per day at levels 11 and 22. The Bastards gains a temporary
  immunity to all magical damage, including elemental, for the duration (15
  seconds). However, the Bastard's movement is halved, and his number of attacks
  reduced.
- Vanity, once per day at levels 15 and 30. All creatures that look at the
  Bastard must Save vs. Spell (-2) or die. Creatures that make a save still
  suffer a temporary blindness.
- Wrath, once per day at levels 7 and 14. The Bastard's strength and
  constitution are increased by 4 points, but his dexterity, intelligence and
  wisdom scores are decreased by 2 points (for 15 seconds).
- May obtain the "Greater Lust" High Level Ability.

Disadvantages:
- May only obtain mastery in Bastards Swords, Short Swords, Daggers and
  Crossbows.
- Must be of Chaotic Neutral or Chaotic Evil alignment.
- Maximum charisma score of 10.
- Only Humans, Dwarves and Half-Orcs may become Bastards.
- Every 5 levels there is a random 10% chance that the Bastard loses one point
  of Wisdom or Charisma.

                            | 25: Bug Fixes  (SoA) |
                            \----------------------/

This component fixes a few very minor bugs in SoA:

Bug: When using Improved Drizzt against Bodhi and you don't allow him to finish
     his 'dialogue' with his friends, he does nothing when you go to the next
     level, except stand there.

Cause: Unknown.

Solution: Let him finish his dialogue, unless you want a useless Drizzt.

                               \----------------/

All components were tested on a clean installation of Baldur's Gate II - Throne
of Bhaal (English version), with the Official Patch v2.6.498, and the Baldurdash
Fix Pack v1.12. No major bugs were encountered during these tests.


If you think you have encountered a bug, please contact the author of that
specific component immediately. Non-component-specific bugs (e.g. problems with
the installation procedure) can be reported to Moonfruit. Also, please include a
list of all other mods installed (or just copy your WeiDU.log file), as well as
the exact in-game location and event where you experienced it. A recent saved
game will also make our bug-hunting tasks a lot easier.
